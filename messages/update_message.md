## 2.6.0

- Remove built-in color codes visualization support.

  Because as of [ColorHelper](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/ColorHelper) 3.6.0,
  it provides support for ASS/SSA color codes. And ColorHelper's functionality is superior
  to this plugin's built-in. Thus, ColorHelper is recommended if you need color codes visualization.
